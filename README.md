# Data-Ethics-Misinformation-Project
## About
This project aims to test the ability of ML and LLMs when it comes to handling misinfomration and fake news. 

## Some Guiding Questions 
* How does AI distinguish real news from the fake news? 
* What is the efficacy and efficency of AI classifying ?
* What are the conequences and blowbacks from minsinformation and AI?
* What are the limitations or failure modes of LLMs when evaluating the truthfulness of news content?
* What are the limitations or failure modes of LLMs when generating news content?
* How does the performance of LLMs compare to that of human fact-checkers on the same news samples?
